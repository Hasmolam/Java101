# ExponentCalculator

This Java program calculates the power of a number (base) raised to an exponent (power).

## Usage

1. Compile the program: `javac ExponentCalculator.java`
2. Run the program: `java ExponentCalculator`
3. Enter the base number and exponent number when prompted.
4. The program will calculate and display the result of base^exponent.

## Notes

- The program uses a `Scanner` object to read user input for the base and exponent.
- It calculates the power using a loop.
- The result is displayed as an integer.

## Limitations

- This program assumes that both the base and exponent are non-negative integers.
- It does not handle negative exponents or non-integer exponents.
