# GcdLcmCalculator

This Java program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

## Usage

1. Compile the program: `javac GcdLcmCalculator.java`
2. Run the program: `java GcdLcmCalculator`
3. Enter the two numbers when prompted.
4. The program will calculate and display the GCD and LCM of the entered numbers.

## Notes

- The program uses a `Scanner` object to read user input for the two numbers.
- It calculates the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
- It calculates the LCM using the relationship: LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b).
