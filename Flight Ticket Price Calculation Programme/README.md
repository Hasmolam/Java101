# Flight Ticket Price Calculation Programme

Make a programme in Java that calculates the price of a plane ticket according to distance and conditions. Get distance (KM), age and type of journey (one way, round trip) information from the user. Take the fare per distance as 0,10 TL / km. 
Firstly calculate the total price of the flight and then apply the following discounts to the customer according to the conditions;

- The values received from the user must be valid (distance and age values must be positive numbers, journey type must be 1 or 2) - - -. Otherwise, the user should be given a warning as ‘You entered incorrect data !’.
- If the person is under 12 years old, 50% discount is applied on the ticket price.
- If the person is between the ages of 12-24, 10% discount is applied on the ticket price.
- If the person is over 65 years old, 30% discount is applied on the ticket price.
