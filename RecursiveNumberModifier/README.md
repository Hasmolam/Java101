# Number Modifier

This Java program modifies a number based on a specific rule using a recursive method.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using any Java compiler.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Enter a number when prompted.
4. The program will modify the number according to the specified rule using recursion.

## How It Works

The program takes a number as input from the user and modifies it according to the following rule recursively:
- If the number is greater than 0, subtract 5 from it and print the current value.
- If the number becomes 0 or negative, print it and start adding 5 back to the number, printing the current value after each addition.

The program uses recursion to repeatedly modify the number until it reaches 0 or negative.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java compiler
