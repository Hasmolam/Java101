# RecursiveFibonacci

This Java program calculates the Fibonacci series using a recursive method.

## Usage

1. Compile the program: `javac RecursiveFibonacci.java`
2. Run the program: `java RecursiveFibonacci`
3. Enter the position of the Fibonacci series element when prompted.
4. The program will display the Fibonacci number at the given position.

## Notes

- The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
- The program uses a recursive method `fib` to calculate the Fibonacci number at a given position.
- The base cases for the recursion are when `n` is 0 or 1. For other values, it recursively calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2`.
