# NumberPrograms

This folder contains two Java programs for working with numbers:

## DigitSumCalculator

This program calculates the sum of digits of a given number.

### Usage

1. Compile the program: `javac DigitSumCalculator.java`
2. Run the program: `java DigitSumCalculator`
3. Enter a number when prompted.
4. The program will calculate and display the sum of its digits.


### Notes

- The program uses a `Scanner` object to read user input.
- It iteratively extracts digits and calculates their sum using a while loop.

## ArmstrongNumberChecker

This program checks whether numbers up to a given number are Armstrong numbers.

### Usage

1. Compile the program: `javac ArmstrongNumberChecker.java`
2. Run the program: `java ArmstrongNumberChecker`
3. Enter a number when prompted.
4. The program will print all Armstrong numbers from 1 up to the entered number.


### Notes

- The program calculates whether a number is an Armstrong number using nested loops and conditional statements.
- Armstrong numbers are numbers that are equal to the sum of their own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
