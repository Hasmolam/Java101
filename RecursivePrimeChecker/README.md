# Prime Checker

This Java program checks if a given number is prime or not using a recursive method.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using any Java compiler.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Enter a number when prompted.
4. The program will output whether the entered number is prime or not.

## How It Works

The program takes a number as input from the user and checks if it is prime using a recursive method.
It iterates over the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, checking if the input number is divisible by any of them.
If the input number is found to be divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, it is not considered prime.
If the input number is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, it is considered prime.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java compiler
