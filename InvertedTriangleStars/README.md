# InvertedTriangleStars

This Java program prints an inverted triangle of stars based on the number of digits entered by the user.

## Usage

1. Compile the program: `javac InvertedTriangleStars.java`
2. Run the program: `java InvertedTriangleStars`
3. Enter the number of digits when prompted.
4. The program will print an inverted triangle of stars.

## Notes

- The program uses a `Scanner` object to read user input for the number of digits.
- It prints the inverted triangle using nested loops: the outer loop controls the number of rows (equal to the number of digits), and the inner loop prints the stars.
- The number of stars in each row decreases as the row number increases.
